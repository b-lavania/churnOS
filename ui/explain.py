**One loop**

1. **Agentic Product Profile** — pick product shape → sets ontology + fake rates  
2. **Generate workspace** — seats, capabilities, runs, approvals, connectors, churn marks  
3. **Decision engine** — finds exceptions per capability, prices *cost of leaving live*  
4. **This Radar** — ranked Decision Cards → you override ship / hold / throttle…  
5. **Outcome Flywheel** — write retention Δ / churn back onto the record (simulated)

In production the warehouse is LangSmith-class traces + ChartMogul-class billing; today it is authored so you can learn the decision object.

| Decision object, taxonomy, semantics | Synthetic seats & runs |
| Exception categories & playbooks | Authored correlation structure |
| Override → outcome flywheel pattern | Fake 14d retention / churn labels |

- **LEARN** — Experiments + Outcome Flywheel (close the loop)
